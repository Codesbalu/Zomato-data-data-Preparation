A must visit place if u love churros.\\\\n\\\\nStarters:\\\\n1. Africano panner -\\\\nIt was bit sweet and not happy with the dish!!\\\\n2. Loaded nachos -\\\\nThis happened to be their one of the best dishes, but now I take back my words.

They're a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce. Milkshakes are good too. The interior walls have murals and writings all over. Haven't tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good.\\\"), ('Rated 3.0', \\\"RATED\\\\n  Honestly, have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains - never tried desserts. So this review is based on starters and mains only. The quality wasn't all that great, was pretty average.\\\"), ('Rated 4.0', \\\"RATED\\\\n  Visited this place for the first time, recently. The ambience was pretty good. We ordered two 'churros for two'. Having churros for the first time ever, I was way too excited and judgmental. But swear to Lord, the churros were heavenly! The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza. It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies.\\\\nThe place is famous for churros (the name suggests so).

Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros.\\\")]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"menu_item\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"listed_in(type)\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Buffet\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"listed_in(city)\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Banashankari\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"only_rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"3.8\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"total_votes_by_1000\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09263098833543773,\n        \"min\": 0.787,\n        \"max\": 0.918,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.918\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_good\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":142}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.iloc[1:10:5]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":375},"id":"bxUl7_iS8Zdn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1766830127902,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":67,"user":{"displayName":"Akula Balaji","userId":"11348532022285755672"}},"outputId":"ecaaa130-458a-440d-a6d5-90e6655fea23"},"execution_count":143,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                 url  \\\n","1  https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/spice-elephan...   \n","6  https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/onesta-banash...   \n","\n","                                             address            name  \\\n","1  2nd Floor, 80 Feet Road, Near Big Bazaar, 6th ...

Also the paneer pasand was very good, with different types and chutney along with salad.\\\\nThe Non-veg starter, Wings of fury was sweet, not going well with the Mayo.\\\\nFor main course, Paneer Alfredo was very bland and lot of seasonings had to be added. Comparatively, the Very Veggie pizza was good. Both are thin crust ones.\\\\nFor drinks, went with Blue shoes. There was lot of ice in it and it eventually lost taste.\\\\nThe service was fast and efficient. Overall a good place.'), ('Rated 5.0', 'RATED\\\\n  This place was in my radar for quite a long time. Its little far away from the usual traffic and once you enter the place you feel so good. It has got a positive vibe to it. he interiors are well done. I liked the interior design of this place. For starters we ordered Uncle Andy chicken and Wings of fury with BBQ sauce. Let me tell you this is one of the best BBQ sauce i ever had. Even the Uncle Andy chicken was crispy and very tasty. I just loved it.\\\\nFor main course we ordered The Mangi and Senorita giselle. Both dish were just awesome.

There aren't many people here on a weekday. The ambience is nice and staff are courteous. We ordered the godfather, some barbecue chicken wings and a few mocktails like mellonicious and Monica sangria. The first round of them were great! But in the second round, the mocktails tasted different and diluted. Now comes the real bad part, the entree. We ordered a few burgers, a pasta and steaks. Burgers were good but the rest weren't. The pasta had a very watery white sauce. The pork belly and the tenderloin steaks we're really salty and tasteless. I sent back my steak and the replacement was also drenched with salt. We had had a long day and it was already around 11 PM. We paid the bill and left disappointed.\\\"), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\\\n  Wonderful place, especially the open seating area. Food was very good, we had the bacon hugs, the wings of fury and boozy prawns, they were terrific. We also had the hazel nut shake, strawberry shake and virgin sangria, the hazel nut one was great but the strawberry shake had more bananas then strawberry so was terribly dissapointed and the sangria was very mild in flavour too.
